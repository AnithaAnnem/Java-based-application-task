This Java program runs a Secret Santa game:

Users add participants and the program randomly assigns who gives a gift to whom.

It prevents anyone from being assigned to themselves and keeps assignments secret using popups.

Includes JUnit tests to ensure assignments are correct and the program works as expected.
